##Explanation of vizualizations

Both vizualizations try to give some context to natural resource revenue from public lands in the U.S. (where it comes from, where it goes, etc).

###VizOne

VizOne attempts to show how much revenue overall is earned on Federal natural resource leases, what the major sectors are, and proportionally how much each contributes to total revenues yearly.

###VizTwo

VizTwo attempts to show where that revenue goes and what it benefits. Also, it tries to show proportionally how much goes where, and how that changed over time.
