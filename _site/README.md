##Explanation of vizualizations

Both vizualizations try to give some context to natural resource revenue from public lands in the U.S. (where it comes from, where it goes, etc).

###VizOne

VizOne attempts to show how much revenue overall is earned on Federal natural resource leases, what the major sectors are, and proportionally how much each contributes to total revenues yearly.

###VizTwo

VizTwo attempts to show where that revenue goes and what it benefits. Also, it tries to show proportionally how much goes where, and how that changed over time.

###PricesPaid

From Sir Robert Read: "I personally would like to see a D3 based replacement for the use of jqplot in the PricesPaid (P3) project. Basically, we are drawing a graph with UnitPrice as the vertical access, time as the horizontal access, color as the vehicle, and Dot Size as the Number of Units bought.  However, one could get more crazy with it that that. This is not super valuable to the P3 project---but it something to play with. It would be hard, however, for me to install P3 with full data for somebody (it takes at least a couple of hours to set up), so someone could just use that as an exercise: build a graph (possibly 3d) based on that kind of data."
